## 2. Hero Section — Messaging Feature Content

- Multiple scrolling text paragraphs about "Getting brands to notice you..."
- Generic messaging about the platform

### Required Changes
- **Display chat interface between brand and creator**
  - Visual design: chat bubbles with left/right alignment
  - Modern, minimal design (reference: https://www.series.so/)
  - Include 2-3 short messages demonstrating natural conversation flow

### Message Content
**Left (Brand message):**

**Right (Creator reply):**
> This looks super cool — I'd love to join!

**Left (Brand follow-up):**
> Amazing! Here's your creator link to get started!

### Implementation Details

  - Proper spacing and typography
  - Optional: brand logo/avatar on left messages
  - Optional: "View Campaign Details" as clickable link/button style

## 3. Campaign Cards Redesign

### Current State
- Two campaign cards (Lincoln & Victoria profiles)
- Generic "AI Productivity App Launch" and "Wellness App Collab"
- Profile photos, match percentages, tags

### Required Changes
- **Replace with three AI tech company campaign cards**
- Cards should overlap iPad screen for depth and dimension
- Each card includes:
  - Company logo (use provided assets if available, or create placeholders)
  - Company name in bold
  - Category tags (2 tags each)
  - One-line campaign brief

### Card Content

#### Card 1: NoteMate
- **Logo**: Orange notepad with smile icon (or placeholder)
- **Company Name**: NoteMate
- **Category Tags**: EdTech · Productivity
- **Brief**: Looking for student creators who love "study-with-me" content

#### Card 2: FitFlow
- **Logo**: Blue fitness/sync icon (or placeholder)
- **Company Name**: FitFlow
- **Category Tags**: Health · Lifestyle
- **Brief**: Looking for lifestyle creators to film their 7-day progress

#### Card 3: ClipKit
- **Logo**: Video editor/mouse icon (or placeholder)
- **Company Name**: ClipKit
- **Category Tags**: Creator Tools · Video
- **Brief**: Recruiting creators who love editing TikToks & Reels

### Layout Strategy
- Position cards to overlap the iPad screen edges
- Create visual hierarchy with varying z-index and positioning
- Maintain 3D rotation effects on scroll (already implemented)
- Consider: 1 card on left, iPad in center, 2 cards on right (or other arrangement)

### Files to Modify
- `CreatorLandingPage.tsx` - Update campaign card JSX structure
- `CreatorLandingPage.module.css` - Adjust positioning for 3 cards
- Create/add logo images to `/public/` directory

---

## 4. How It Works Section — Layout Update

### Current State
- Left: Interactive workflow steps (1-4) with sliding highlight pill
- Right: MacBook laptop mockup image

### Required Changes
- **Remove laptop screen mockup entirely**
- **Replace with modular graphic cards** that visually showcase each step
- Design approach similar to:
  - monday.com - colorful modular cards with illustrations
  - passionfroot.me/creators - clean step visualization
- Each step should have its own visual card/graphic representation

### Implementation Options
1. **Option A**: Grid of visual cards below the steps text
2. **Option B**: Each step has integrated visual next to text
3. **Option C**: Single large card that changes based on active step

### Recommended Approach
- Keep the interactive step selector on the left
- Right side shows visual card corresponding to active step
- Visual cards can include:
  - Mockup screenshots
  - Illustrations
  - Icon-based graphics
  - Color-coded backgrounds

### Files to Modify
- `CreatorLandingPage.tsx` - Remove MacBook image, add card system
- `CreatorLandingPage.module.css` - Update `.workflowVisual` styles

## 5. Workflow Steps Content Update

### Current State
**Step 1**: Select Your Platform  
**Step 2**: Discover Campaigns for You  
**Step 3**: Apply & Collaborate  
**Step 4**: Submit & Get Paid

### Required Changes
- **Remove Step 2: "Discover Campaigns for You"**
- **Restructure to 3 steps**

### New Step Content

#### Step 1: Build Your Profile
**Title**: Build Your Profile  
**Description**: Connect your TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube — we'll instantly build your creator profile with data pulled from your content and engagement.

#### Step 2: Apply & Collaborate
**Title**: Apply & Collaborate  
**Description**: Browse campaigns that match your niche and apply directly to brands you actually like.

#### Step 3: Submit & Get Paid
**Title**: Submit & Get Paid  
**Description**: Deliver your content and get paid securely once the brand approves your post.

### Implementation Notes
- Update step numbering (1, 2, 3 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Update `activeStep` state logic to handle 3 steps
- Update `stepRefs` array length
- Ensure highlight pill transitions correctly
